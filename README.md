# Hack Oregon Housing Project, 2016-2017
This project will create a dynamic, educational portal that helps clarify the multifaceted and changing rental environment in PDX, with a focus on affordable rentals. The team will investigate what parts of town are currently affordable to a diverse spectrum of residents, and explore trends in how the Portland housing and rental market has changed over time, with a special emphasis on recent changes in the 7-year census gap. The project will approach common perceptions of the state of affordable rent in Portland with a range of digital, analytical, and creative strategies, with the overall goal of broadening insight on the experience of renting in Portland.
The most current version of Team Housing's Vision Document / Elevator Pitch is maintained by Gabriele Hayden.

## Prerequisites

If you are running a recent edition of MacOS, Windows 10 Professional, or Linux, you need Docker and Git:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

If you are using an older version of Windows, you'll have need to use either Docker Toolbox, which is temperamental and not covered, or run Docker in a Vagrant box, provided here:

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
* [Vagrant for Docker](https://github.com/JohnTasto/vagrant-for-docker)
* [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

## Working with Git

### Set up repositories:

From GitHub, fork the Repo at [https://github.com/hackoregon/housing-backend](https://github.com/hackoregon/housing-backend).

Clone the GitHub repository using SSH or HTTPS:
```
# SSH:
$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/housing-backend.git
# HTTPS:
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/housing-backend.git
```

Add upstream remote repository:
```
# SSH:
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:hackoregon/housing-backend.git
# HTTPS:
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/hackoregon/housing-backend.git
```

### Do some coding:

Make a feature branch:  
[optional]
```
git branch <branchname>
git checkout <branchname>
# or the shorthand:
git checkout -b <branchname>
```

Add and commit your changes:
```
git add .
git commit -m "a meaningful commit message in the imperative present tense"
```

Merge back into master:  
[optional - if working from a feature branch]
```
git checkout master
git rebase <branchname>
```

### Submit changes back to Github:

Download changes other's may have made and merge with your changes:
```
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
```

Push changes back to your own fork:
```
git push -f origin master
```

### Submit a Pull Request!

### Other helpful commands:

List changed / uncommitted files:
```
$ git status
```

List the current branches of the repository:
```
$ git branch -a
```

## Services Development Environment

### Dependencies

* Docker or Docker toolkit
* (Optional) Travis-CI - Contact the DevOps Team
* (Optional) Cluster deployment keys - Contact the DevOps Team
* (Optional) ECR Password - Contact the DevOps Team
* (Optional) ECS Service Name - Contact the DevOps Team

### How to build

#### 1. Create the environment file

* Create `env.sh` in the project with the following contents:

```bash
#! /bin/bash
# Setup project specifics - Make sure env.sh is in the .gitignore and .dockerignore
export DOCKER_IMAGE=housing-service
export PROJ_SETTINGS_DIR=housingAPI
export DEPLOY_TARGET=dev
echo "##############################"
echo  Local Project Environment
echo "##############################"
echo DOCKER_IMAGE $DOCKER_IMAGE
echo PROJ_SETTINGS_DIR $PROJ_SETTINGS_DIR
echo DEPLOY_TARGET $DEPLOY_TARGET
```

* Run `chmod +x backend/bin/env.sh` to make the script file executable

#### 2. Setup your local environment

* Run `source env.sh` to setup your environment

#### 3. Build & test the container services

* Run `backend/bin/build-proj -l` to build your container locally
* Run `backend/bin/test-proj -l` to test your container locally

#### 4. Start the project

* Make sure you've got a local copy of your project's `backend/backend/project_config.py` - Contact the DevOps Team 
* Run `backend/bin/start-proj -l` to view your service's Swaggerized API

### (troys, original, 15apr) Start:

Run Django and PostgreSQL:
```
$ cd housing-backend/backend
$ docker-compose up
```

You can also run it in the background:
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
It looks like it starts faster this way, but give it a bit to import data into
the database in the background before trying to view it in a browser.

### Shutdown:

```
$ docker-compose down
  # or
$ docker-compose down --rmi all   # remove images to save disk space
```

### Rebuild images (necessary if `requirements.txt` changes):

```
$ docker-compose down   # (if not already shut down)
$ docker-compose up --build
```

### Container access examples:

Run manage.py command directly:

```
docker-compose exec web ./manage.py <command>
```

Run the Python shell:

```
docker-compose exec web ./manage.py shell
```

Run the PostgreSQL shell:

```
docker-compose exec --user postgres db psql
```
